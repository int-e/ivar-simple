0.3.3   (2020-10-06)
	* use only one `MVar` per `IVar` instead of two, taking advantage
	  of the fact that `readMVar` has been atomic since ghc 7.10
	* add `Eq` instance and `uncons` operation for `IChan`
	  (suggested by ski@Freenode)

0.3.2   (2015-10-29)
	* add `Eq` instances for `IVar` and `MIChan`
	  (suggested by nwf@Freenode)

0.3.1   (2015-07-02)
	* fix building with ghc 7.8

0.3     (2012-07-24)
	* change NonTermination to a custom BlockedIndefinitelyOnIVar
	  exception, and require base >= 4. (using NonTermination leads to
	  <<loop>> messages)

0.2     (2012-07-23)
	* change BlockedIndefinitely exception (gone since ghc 7.0) to
	  NonTermination

0.1.0.2 (2009-06-03)
	* depend on base < 5 instead of base.

0.1.0.1 (2009-01-11)
	* make Data.IVar.Simple.tryWrite exception safe
	  (noticed by Chris Kuklewicz)

0.1.0.0 (2009-01-11)
	* initial version
